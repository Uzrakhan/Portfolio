          Hi, I‚Äôm Uzra Khan, a passionate and dedicated self-taught Fullstack Developer. I recently focused my learning on the modern web development stack, including <strong>React/Next.js for the frontend</strong> and <strong>Node.js/Express for the backend</strong>.
          <br/><br/>
          Although I don't have formal, paid work experience, I have channeled all my effort into building <strong>real-world, hands-on projects</strong> that demonstrate my ability to design, develop, and deploy fullstack applications.
